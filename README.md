The project is implementation of MIFARec model. All of auther data are hided for double-blind review.
Refered to the paper: 'MIFARec: Mixed-Interest-based Fourier Analysis Network for Time-Specific Recommendation'.

Method to run the project:
1, Config the software of python and CUDA. It supports Windows and Linux both.
2, Modify ROOT_PATH and MAIN_PATH to corresponding file path.
3, Run the file 'src/main.py', and the recommendation performance data will be printed out to 'test_result.txt' which is in root path.
4, Performance data of baseline models could be refered to ReChorus project: https://github.com/THUwangcy/ReChorus.
